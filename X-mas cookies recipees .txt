Chewy Ginger Molasses Cookies
(recipee shared by Jamie)

***Ingredients:***

1 1/2 cups (300g)	softened butter
2 cups (250-300g) 	granulated sugar
1/2 cup (200g)		molasses

2 			eggs

4 cups (520g)		all purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground cloves
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp salt

***Directions:***

Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celsius.

In a medium bowl, whisk together four, soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and salt. Set aside.
 
In the bowl of an elecric stand mixer, beat together butter and sugar on medium speed for 1 minute until light and fluffy.
  Add in the eggs and molasses, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. Gradually add in the dry ingredient mixture and beat until combined.

Roll the dough into small balls, about 2-3 cm in diameter.  Fill a small bowl with sugar, and roll each ball in the sugar until it is completely coated.
Place on cookie sheet at least 3 cm  apart**, then bake for about 8-10min, until the cookies begin to slightly crack on top.
(They may crack more while cooling.)  Remove from the oven and let cool for a minute or two. Then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Serve immediately or store in a sealed container for up to 1 week.

**For thicker cookies, I recommend chilling the dough for at least 15-20 min in the refrigerator after you have shaped the dough balls.
(I just slide the entire baking sheet with dough into the refrigerator.) This will help the butter to firm back up, and the cookies will flatten less while baking.

220g flour
100g butter

a pinch of salt (fine grain)

Add sugar, salt and ground hazlenuts. Then mix in the eggs, and continue mixing until the dough is well combined.

Let the dough rest for an hour.

Roll out the dough, until the dough is 7mm thick.  Using a pie crust cutter or a knife, cut the dough into battons that are 8cm long and 1.5cm wide.

Place the battons onto a buttered baking sheet, glaze them with the egg yolk and bake them in the oven (180 degrees C) for 15 min.

***Ingredients:***

1 cup (200g) butter or regular margarine, softened
1/2 cup (<100g) sugar
2 tsp almond extract
6 drops green food color
2 1/2 cups (300g) sifted all-purpose flour (sift before measuring)
powdered sugar

***Directions:***

In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter with 1/2 cup sugar, almond extract, and food color until light and fluffy.

With wooden spoon, stir in flour until smooth and well combined

Divide dough into 2 parts, refrigerate, covered, 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).

On lightly sugared pastry cloth, roll out dough, one part at a time, about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick.

Cut out cookies, place 1 inch (3 cm) apart on ungreased cookie sheets. With end of wooden spoon, make an indentation in center of each cookie.

Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until light golden around edges.

While still warm, roll in sugar.

Cool completely on wire rack

--> Same recipee can be made without the almond extract, green food coloring and powdered sugar.  Just replace sugar with flour for the instruction of rolling out dough.

Saffran Buns (ljussbullar/ Saffransbullar - traditional Swedish pastry)
(recipee shared by Mona)

***Ingredients:***

50g yeast for sweet dough ( we have used normal live baker's yeast)
5 cups milk
150g butter
250g quark / kesella
a giant pinch of saffran (flower format)
1 tsp salt
c.a. 800g flour (final result: dough that looks like it is for bread)

for the decoration:
raisins
egg

***Directions:***
/!\ There are many recipees on the internet, and the one we've used was slightly adapted (in addition I didn't find the one we've used again either...)

Heat the butter and milk in a saucepan to lukewarm (or slightly higher)

We've added here the Saffron, in order to give it more time to seep.

Crumble the yeast, and mix it with a portion of the warm milk until it has entirely dissolved.  Add to the rest of the liquid.

Mix in the Kesella, sugar and salt.

Add in the flour a little at a time and knead the dough until it has the consistency of bread dough.

Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rise at room temperature for approx. 60min.

Knead dough for a few minutes.

 Divide the dough into approx. 30 pieces.
Roll the pieces into strings that are 2cm in diameter
Form an S-shape out of each string, by "curling" the ends towards the centre.
Place on a baking sheet that is greased or lined with baking paper.

Press a rasin into the middle of each swirl

Let the dough rise again for 45min or until doubled in size (we did not do this step)

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees C.

Beat the egg (optional, add 1 tbs milk to glaze), and brush buns with the mixture.

Bake in the oven 5-8 minutes, until they become golden brown.

Remove the buns and let them cool on a rack.
